# JS_V21_ROLLUP_NPM_MICRO

Part of the `javascript-combos` white-box test-repo corpus (GraniteMill /
`granite-mill`, domain: Community garden plots).

- **Node.js:** 21.7.3 (family V21)
- **Bundler:** Rollup
- **Package manager:** npm
- **Architecture:** Microservices

The application code under `src/` (or `packages/*/src/` for Microservices
branches) is byte-identical across all 576 branches of this corpus; only the
build tool, package manager, architecture layout, and the resolved tool-pin
table below vary.
